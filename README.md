# Facehair400 Project 1 - Git and VSCode familiarization

A super small and simple project to introduce people to version control and VSCod


## Installation

How do you install the project?

eg
```
npm instal
```
or whatever

But for now, there's no installation! This project is just a static set of nonsense

The project was build by following [An ABSOLUTE Beginner's Guide to Software Engineering and Web Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wt47gSihb5s&list=PLJjxqjPti-LfbLhTs-XSNecyqBOtRB0fS&ab_channel=Facehair4000)
